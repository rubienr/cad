# Summary

NEW VERSION:
- As many users have requested requested, the tip is now inclined so the air blows directly bellow de nozzle;
- A full sleeve has been added to minimize the airflow loss beetween this part and the blower;
- Better dimentions;
- I've included the gcode I used on my CR-10 to print this part (for PLA only) in the file section as well as the STL of the new version.

This is an easy to mount cooling mod for the Creality CR-10, the other CR series and the Ender 3.

This mod redirects the fan air flow directly to the tip of the nozzle without being too big or obstructive. If you are looking for the best print quality this is definitely a must for your Creality printer.

To mount it you just need to remove the two screws holding the default part in place. Remove the default part and insert the modded part.

There are two slightly different parts in the files. One of the parts is 0.8 mm shorter in height than the other. I recommend you to print the shorter version if the regular part sits too low when mounted on the printer head.
I've uploaded the shorter version because some people reported that their part was touching the build plate and because of that I've fixed that issue.

Hope you enjoy it! And If you do make sure to like this project! Thank you!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Creality
Printer: CR-10
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1 mm
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
This part has small details so it is better to print it with an high resolution (0.1mm works well).

I recommend you to use a brim to avoid warping.

Do not use rafts
